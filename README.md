# NTU AI6103 ASSIGNMENT

----
In all the experiments, you will use the ResNet-18 network and the CIFAR-10 dataset. You should
use the SGD optimization algorithm with momentum set to 0.9. You should not use other optimization
algorithms like Adam or Adagrad. The code has been provided as a Colab notebook on NTULearn,
which you can modify as you see fit.
